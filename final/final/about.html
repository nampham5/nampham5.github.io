        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Our Story</h3>
        
        <p style = "line-height: 2;">At <strong> Pacific Trails Resort</strong>, we started off as just another group of friends exploring nature through the Pacific Coast and the Pacific Crest Trail. However, coming back from our trip and looking into our daily lives,
        we realized how separated we as people have become with nature and the natural world around us. In this growing age of internet and online dependencies, it is more important now than ever to be mindful of how we spend our time especially if more and more of it is 
    spent attached to a screen or monitor. As such, we decided to form the Pacific Trails Resort in order to allow for more and more people to take the breaks they need from this purely digital lifestyle and reconnect with themselves and nature.
