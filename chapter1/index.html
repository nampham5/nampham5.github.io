    <p>Besides water, one of my favorite beverages to enjoy especially when I am out with friends is milk tea with boba. 
        While this drink is often incredibly sweet, I feel as though good boba milk tea hits a nice spot in the balance between the caramelized brown sugar and 
        the strong black tea flavor to create a treat that isnâ€™t overbearing in the amount of sugar that it tastes like. 
        Additionally, the boba part of the drink serves as a fun treat to chew on while you enjoy the flavor and texture variety.</p>
